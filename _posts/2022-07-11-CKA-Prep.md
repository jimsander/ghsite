Having only the most basic high-level hands-on experience with k8s in the past, I thought why not immerse myself a little to prep for the [CKA Exam](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka/). 

First, I deployed a small cluster (1c 2n) on my home network, then took a couple of [A Cloud Guru Courses](https://acloudguru.com/), went through their non-industry certificate of completion, and finally, went through 
[KelseyHightower's Deploying Kubernetes the Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way), a bit dated but all relevant. 

Afterwards, I thought I was about ready to begin my first pass at the test.  I say **first** because, they give you one free re-take, and I was pretty sure I'd flub the initial, **which I did**.   The failure wasn't soley on knowledge of the material, rather, the online exam method they use is a virtual "keyhole"; it's a remote linux desktop.  

# Tips for efficiency 
## Linux Desktop "Navigation"

Now, I'm a Linux fan, but not a Linux desktop fan, and avoid using the GUI if I can help it. However, the 
CKA **PSI Bridge** (as they call it) allows only 2 apps:
1. Terminal
2. Firefox

The questions are posed in the left of the "portal" where they give you a `k8s config use <cluster_name>` for each question, and to ensure you don't **typo** anything,  **copy and paste** the strings into the terminal.   

Not so bad, but I was used to using my macbook for command-C or V and Command-F for most cut-and-paste. In the Linux desktop it's slighly different

1. terminal : 
 - shift+control+C or V
2. firefox: 
 - control-F to search page
 - control-C to copy text

Although it's NOT a big deal, it was enough to fluster me to where it chewed up a good bit of my 2 hour window. 

## Shortcuts/Aliases
Obviously, time is of the essence here. So, when you first start, get your aliases established:

### File: .kuberc
When **seconds** count on the exam, **TAKE A MINUTE or two** to get this in your _.bash_profile_ or wherever.

```
source <(kubectl completion bash)
alias k=kubectl

complete -o default -F __start_kubectl k
export dry="--dry-run=client -o yaml"
alias kns="k config set-context --current --namespace "
alias kgns="k config view --minify -o jsonpath '{..namespace}'; echo"
alias kcd="k create $dry"
alias kcr="k create "
alias kgp="k get po"
alias kgn="k get nodes"
alias kgall="k get nodes,po,svc,ep -o wide"
```

## "Template" the spec files
My first pass, I was hunting and pecking in the k8s documention for examples of YAML specs for the various questions, and this was a HUGE waste of time.  The better way is to use `kubectl create --dry-run=client ..` and modify the output

For example, one question involved creating a replicaset. Now, there's no way to create a replicaset from just command line, so create a deployment, and modify the template.
```
kcd deployment foo --image nginx | tee rs_foo.yml
# change 'kind' to ReplicaSet
# remove 'strategy'
kcd -f rs_foo.yml
```

There's a couple of other tips, but can't think of them at the moment, will add them as I recall.
