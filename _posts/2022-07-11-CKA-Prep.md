Having only the most basic high-level hands-on experience with k8s in the past, I thought why not immerse myself a little to prep for the [CKA Exam](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka/). 

I took a couple of [A Cloud Guru Courses](https://acloudguru.com/) and went through their non-industry certificate of completion, I thought I was about ready to begin my first pass at the test.  I say **first** because, they give you one free re-take, and I was pretty sure I'd flub the initial, **which I did**.   The failure wasn't soley on knowledge of the material, rather, the online exam method they use is a virtual "keyhole"; it's a remote linux desktop.  

Now, I'm a Linux fan, but not a Linux desktop fan, and avoid using the GUI if I can help it. However, the 
[CKA PSI Bridge (as they call it) allows only 2 apps:
1. Terminal
2. Firefox

```bash
awk this shit out of this

```

The questions are posed in the left of the "portal" where they give you a `k8s config use <cluster_name>` for each question, and to ensure you don't **typo** anything cut and paste the strings into the terminal.   Not so bad, but I was used to using my macbook for command-C or V and Command-F for browser search.   In the Linux desktop it's slighly different

 - terminal : shift+control+C or V
 - firefox: 
   - control-F to search page
   - control-C to copy text

Not a big deal, but it was enough to fluster me to where it chewed up a good bit of my 2 hour window.  Obviously, time is of the essence here.

When **seconds** count on the exam, **TAKE A MINUTE or two** to get this in your _.bash_profile_

```
source <(kubectl completion bash)
alias k=kubectl

complete -o default -F __start_kubectl k
export dry="--dry-run=client -o yaml"
alias kns="k config set-context --current --namespace "
alias kgns="k config view --minify -o jsonpath '{..namespace}'; echo"
alias kcd="k create $dry"
alias kcr="k create "
alias kgp="k get po"
alias kgn="k get nodes"
alias kgall="k get nodes,po,svc,ep -o wide"
```
