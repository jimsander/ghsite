## Who am I
Can safely categorize myself as an [IT Generalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology_generalist){:target="_blank"}. My career has taken me to various clients installing various deployments of various platforms and architurectures. From single host to multi-host in zoned networks, from on-prem to cloud. Installing IBM Tivoli products for event management, monitoring and configuration management,  VMWare ESX servers, a multi-Cloud Management product (enStratius), Jenkins services for multiple teams, setting up and managing Azure multi-tenant subscriptions and associated ADs and RBAC policies, and it's a given that all of this required supporting and troubleshooting for/with customers and/or developers. 

## What next?
The last decade has been exciting for operations and development. Infrastructure as code, proliferation of containerization, micro-services athe evolution of collaboration between operations and devopment (DevOps), pipelines for Continuos Integration testing, and of course all the alure of Continuos Deployment (a much more complex concept), and all hoisted onto kubernetes for orchestration, scalability and fault-tolerance.

This is what I want to delve into.
