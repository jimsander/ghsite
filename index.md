## What is this Funky Look?

<div class="content">
<p>
Yes, it looks pretty cheesy, almost back to 1996, but there's a purpose.

I'm exploring how to setup a jekyll dev env and push to github-pages.  

It's a bit <b>quirky</b>, but fun.

<p>Liquid Syntax is new to me, but just another (templating) language. </p>

Interesting side note: <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/" target="_blank">Shopify created it</a>

## JAM / MASH Stack
</div>
<div class="content">
<p>
I'm just experimenting with "JAM Stack" (JavaScript, API, Markup/down) or as some suggest, "MASH Stack" (Markup/down, API, Static Hosted) 
</p>
<p>
The simplified concept is that front end content is "static", meaning, the content is pre-built then pushed to cloud storage/CDNs.  Don't confuse 'static' with do-nothing presentation only content, rather, javascript and API calls can make the content dynamic.  
</p>
<p>
The big difference is that with the **OLD** web server model, pages were rendered by calling a backend db, which is overkill, and didn't scale well.
