## What is this Funky Look?
Learning how to setup a jekyll dev env and posting to github-pages.  
Quirky but fun.

Liquid Syntax is new to me, but just another language (templating in this case).

Interesting side note: [Shopify created it.](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/){:target="_blank"}

```
{% if page.show_sidebar %}
> Iterate through posts
{% endif %}
```
